# Exponentiation is the raising of one number to the power of another.
# This operation is performed using two asterisks **.

# Let's use exponentiation to solve a known problem.
# You are offered a choice of either $1.000.000 or $0.01 (one penny)
# doubled every day for 30 days (the resulting amount is doubled every day).

# Task:
# Write a program to calculate the amount that will result 
# from the doubling to understand which choice results in a larger amount.


# Solution:
print ((0.1*(2**30)/10))
