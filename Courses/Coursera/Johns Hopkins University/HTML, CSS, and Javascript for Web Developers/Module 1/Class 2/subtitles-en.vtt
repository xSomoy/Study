[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.033
In this lecture we going to go over how
to set up your development environment.

3
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.680
So what tools are you going to need for
this course?

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.200
So number one is you're going to need to
sign up for an account on GitHub.com.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.949
Number two is we're going to heavily
rely on the Google Chrome browser, so

6
00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.620
you definitely download and install that.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.490
And the Google Chrome browser already
comes with what's called CDT,

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.330
otherwise known as Chrome Developer Tools.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.560
And we're going to be using them
pretty extensively as well.

10
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.400
Okay.
You need a code editor.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.070
So the recommended code editor that I'll
be at least using will be Sublime Text 3.

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.960
Now I'll show you in a minute how
to download it and install it.

13
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.723
But Sublime Text 3 technically
still in beta release, but

14
00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:52.614
it's been in beta release for years and
it's in fact the developer of Sublime

15
00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:56.670
says that that is the recommended
one to download and use.

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.700
So, it's not a problem to use
it even though it's beta.

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.770
There are a couple of other code editors
that I would recommend looking at.

18
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.580
One is Visual Studio Code,
that's a pretty new editor.

19
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.030
Another one is Brackets, Brackets.IO.

20
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.600
But Sublime is extremely fast, and

21
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.570
very well supported,
in terms of third party plugins and so on.

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.120
So, definitely would recommend that.

23
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.090
We're going to also need Git and
we'll talk about Git a little bit more.

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.240
And we're also going to need this
tool called Browser Sync and

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.820
you'll see how we're going to use that.

26
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.090
And in order to install Browser Sync
we're going to need to install NodeJs.

27
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.300
So we're going to split up
this lecture in two lectures.

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.649
One, I'm going to show you a couple
kind of preliminary things and

29
00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.210
this is I'm just going to show
you on this machine right here.

30
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.510
And then I'm going to split up part
two into one will be for Windows and

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.610
one will be for Mac.

32
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.540
Show you the installations of Git and
Browser Sync and NodeJs.

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.770
Okay, so, the first thing is,
I am going to go ahead and

34
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.780
skip how to install Google Chrome browser.

35
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.750
Really hoping you know how to
install a browser by yourself.

36
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.030
You'll just, either, Google for it or
maybe you're using it all ready.

37
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.690
And there's nothing really to install
in terms Chrome Developer Tools,

38
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.050
they already come together with
every Chrome browser download.

39
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.980
So there's really nothing to do there.

40
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.270
In terms of signing up for GitHub.

41
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.430
We're going to use GitHub extensively
throughout the course and all you have to

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.380
sign up by giving username, your email,
create a password, and you're good to go.

43
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.400
There's really nothing much to it.

44
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400
The third thing you're going to need
is that at least I'll show you in

45
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.740
part two of this lecture is Sublime Text.

46
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.450
So go ahead and in Sublime and
go ahead and search.

47
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.260
Can't think and type at the same time,
Sublime Text 3.

48
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.610
If you, I misspelled that,
that's excellent, okay, here we go.

49
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.120
So Sublime Text 3,
hopefully you'll spell it properly.

50
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
And you go ahead and click.

51
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.790
Make sure you do Sublime Text 3,

52
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.190
not just Sublime Text, because you're
going to end up on Sublime Text 2 webpage.

53
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.790
So if you click on Sublime Text 3,

54
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.960
you'll see that you have a bunch
of downloads here for Mac OS,

55
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.920
for Windows or for
Windows 64 bit version, or for Linux.

56
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.690
So you can basically pick whatever flavor
you'd like, you download it, double click

57
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.140
it, or drag and drop, whatever, depending
on which operating system you're on.

58
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.710
There's really nothing much for
me to show you there other than

59
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.950
this is the page where you download the
installer, and you're really good to go.

60
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.970
Okay, so I'm going to wrap
up part one of this lecture.

61
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.308
And part two of this lecture, we're going
to split again, into one being Windows,

62
00:03:31.308 --> 00:03:32.359
another being Mac.

63
00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.699
And I'll show you how to install Git,
and Browser Sync together, with NodeJs.
