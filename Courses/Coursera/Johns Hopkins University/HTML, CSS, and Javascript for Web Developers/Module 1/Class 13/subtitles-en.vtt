00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:09.050
In this lecture we're going to
talk about HTMLl lists.

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.500
Now, lists are an incredibly useful
HTML structure that allows you to

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.050
group related content.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.600
If you think about it we,

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.560
as regular people we think
of things In terms of lists.

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.510
To do lists, shopping lists, so on.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.570
And therefore it's totally
natural that lists appeal

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.300
to us as an organization tool.

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.590
Let's go ahead and
jump straight into the code and

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.720
take a look as to how to
implement these lists in HTML.

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.400
Okay assignment sublime text and

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.360
I'm looking at the document called
unordered-lists-before.html.

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.020
And the file is located in
the examples lecture 07 folder.

14
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.170
And as you can see her we have
a list here in front of us,

15
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.000
my typical dinner shopping list.

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.750
Milk Donuts, cookies, some different types
of cookies, and then obviously at the end,

17
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.110
Pepto Bismol.

18
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.960
So what we'd like to do is produce
a bulleted list in our HTML document.

19
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.360
So if you look at the page right now,

20
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.992
the way it looks in the browser,
is you can see there is no list.

21
00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:14.020
It's just a bunch of
spaces in between them.

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.170
And the reason that is,
as I've told you before, all the different

23
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.150
new line characters or any other separator
characters such as tabs, extra spaces,

24
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.990
they're really all ignored by the browser
and only one space is honored.

25
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.300
And since typically, our shopping list
is not something we need to buy in order

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.210
we can use an unordered list for
this example.

27
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.100
So the way you create an unordered list
is you specify a ul unordered list

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.030
ul tag around your entire content, and

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.860
every item within the list Is in li tag,
otherwise known as list items.

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.043
So let's go ahead and

31
00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:50.675
indent this and surround every one
of these items with and li tag.

32
00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:57.149
When we get to the cookies item we
could see that the cookies item

33
00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.190
contains more than just the word cookies.

34
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.730
It actually contains its
own list inside of it.

35
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.818
Which means the content of our li should
really expand not just the cookies,

36
00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:12.210
but expand all the way to chocolate,
sugar, and peanut butter.

37
00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:20.569
And it also means that we need to create
another unordered list inside our

38
00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.550
cookies item.

39
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.190
Let's go ahead and indent this and

40
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.150
we'll surround each one of
these items in an li as well.

41
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.530
Last but not least, Pepto Bismol is
supposed to be surrounded by an li tag as

42
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.290
well, and that list item really belongs
to our original unordered list.

43
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.620
So let's save the document, and
let's refresh and look at it in a browser.

44
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.280
And here we go.

45
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.600
We have our unordered list.

46
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.967
As the last step, let's make sure that
we actually wrote HTML that is valid and

47
00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:58.417
we'll cut and
paste the HTML into the W3C validator.

48
00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.743
As you can see, our HTML page is valid But
let's see what happens if I take one

49
00:03:07.743 --> 00:03:12.780
of the items in my unordered list and
simply remove the li tags around it.

50
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.700
In this case I remove the li tag
around the Pepto Bismol list item.

51
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.210
If we check it again, we see that the HTML
that was written is now invalid and

52
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.910
the reason is, it says, text not
allowed inside ul In this context.

53
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.320
And what it's telling you is that the only
thing is allowed inside a ul element

54
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.960
is an li element.

55
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.480
Anything else is not allowed.

56
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.370
There are lists out there that
absolutely require some ordering to it.

57
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.030
For example,

58
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.340
I'm looking at ordered-lists-before.html
in the same folder, examples > Lecture07.

59
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.880
And here there's a very important
procedure called Oreo cookie

60
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.010
eating procedure and it's important that
this procedure is followed step by step,

61
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.780
without mixing up step one and step two.

62
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.730
So as you can see in terms of our html,
the only difference is that our ul tag

63
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.550
got replaced with an ol tag,
which stands for ordered list.

64
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.050
But the li items are exactly the same.

65
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.640
And the way we treat a sublist
within an ordered list

66
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.560
is also exactly the same as we
treated it within the unordered list.

67
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.440
So, for example,
here we have make a double Oreo,

68
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.690
which is list item that has its
own step-by-step instructions.

69
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.600
And it does appear inside an ol,
which is ordered list, inside the lI item.

70
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.150
So this item right here,
contains an ordered list inside of it.

71
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.977
Let's take a look what this page
looks like, in the browser.

72
00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:45.370
And here's our ordered list.

73
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.050
Our Oreo cookie eating procedure.

74
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.300
Open box, take out cookie,
make a double Oreo, has its own list.

75
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.020
Which is peel off the top part,
place another cookie in the middle, and

76
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.470
put back the top part.

77
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.570
And the fourth one is enjoy.

78
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.910
Wow there's so many things
you're learning in this course.

79
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.910
In summary, lists provide a natural and
commonly used grouping for content.

80
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.910
Very often lists I use for structuring
navigation portions of the web page.

81
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.556
Next we're going to be talking about
HTML character entity references.
