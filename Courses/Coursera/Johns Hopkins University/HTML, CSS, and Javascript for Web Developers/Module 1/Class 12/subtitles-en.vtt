00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.504
[SOUND]
Okay, so in this lecture,

2
00:00:06.504 --> 00:00:11.010
we're going to talk about heading elements
and some new HTML5 semantic elements.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.270
First of all,
what does the word semantic mean?

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.250
Well, definition of semantic is relating
to meaning in language or logic.

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.560
In other words,

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.210
it has some inherent meaning,
the names have some inherent meaning.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.571
Now when it applies to HTML,
what does semantic html element mean?

8
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:35.047
Well, a semantic html element
is an element that implies some

9
00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:36.860
meaning to the content.

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.627
In other words, it's an element that
tells you something about the content,

11
00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:46.107
whether its importance, whether it's
a little bit of its description,

12
00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:48.727
it basically hints to you to that meaning.

13
00:00:48.727 --> 00:00:52.458
Now the reason that's important
is because us, humans, and

14
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:57.122
machines can understand the meaning of
that content surrounded by a semantic

15
00:00:57.122 --> 00:01:01.713
tag much better than if we just surround
it with some tag that doesn't really

16
00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:07.370
tell us anything other than this is some
sort of a division within the document.

17
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.360
And also,
it may help search engine rankings.

18
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.300
In other words, SEO and SEO stands for
search engine optimization.

19
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.530
Now I stress may here because
there is some controversy and

20
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.550
disagreement among experts
if this is really true.

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.280
Now experts who disagree with this
say that modern search engines are so

22
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.200
sophisticated nowadays that just about

23
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.140
nothing other than the content itself
affects the ranking of the page.

24
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.040
So you're welcome to go and Google for
the words, do semantic HTML5

25
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.210
tags help SEO, and you could see
a lot of discussion on this topic.

26
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.007
Now let's take a look at an example
of the first type of semantic tags

27
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.046
that we're going to look at, the headings.

28
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:58.945
Okay, so here, I'm in Sublime Text and
I'm in the examples Lecture06 folder

29
00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:05.520
looking at the file called headings.html,
and this is a very simple HTML document.

30
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.924
It has all the h1 elements, h1, h2,
h3 and all the way to the h6 element,

31
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:16.702
well, basically,
all the available heading elements.

32
00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:21.358
And what these headings are trying to
convey is that the heading content

33
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:25.160
between opening h1 and
the closing h1 element is the most

34
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.500
important heading in the document,
and on, and on, and on.

35
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.190
So h6 would be also a heading
of the document, but

36
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.340
it's the least important one of them all.

37
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.200
So, let's take a look at what this
document looks like in the browser,

38
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.070
and here it is.

39
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.363
So we can see the browser defaulted
to styling that basically,

40
00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.690
visually tells us that
this is the main heading.

41
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.054
Heading number 2 is a little
less important and on and

42
00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:56.000
on all the way to Subheading 6, which
is the least important of the headings.

43
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.540
Couple of important points to
understand about these elements.

44
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.820
First, even though their default rendering
in the browser appears to give them

45
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.690
visual distinction,
these should not be used for styling.

46
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.730
These elements are only meant to convey
structure of your HTML page, nothing more.

47
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.800
With CSS,

48
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.490
any regular development can be styled to
look like any one of these heading tags.

49
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.570
So, why not just use a div?

50
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.570
Because if we did, we would lose
the meaning of what a heading is.

51
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.377
Second, something that's marked h1
is obviously the most important and

52
00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.899
generalized description of
the content of this page.

53
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:37.891
And while there are disagreements among
the SEO experts about how effective

54
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:42.649
these semantic tags are for helping
your search engine rank in general,

55
00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:48.343
everyone agrees that when it comes to the
heading tags, and specifically the h1 tag,

56
00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:53.569
that it is of utmost importance to use it
and that it should contain the wording,

57
00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.859
which truly conveys the central
topic of the rest of the content.

58
00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.863
Okay, so let's take a look at another HTML
document called semantic-elements.html.

59
00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:07.651
And that file is located in
the examples Lecture06 folder right

60
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:11.753
next to the headings.html
file that we just looked at.

61
00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:17.326
And in this document, I introduced
a whole bunch of new HTML5 semantic tags.

62
00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:19.680
And so, let's go over them right now.

63
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.350
So the first thing you see here
is the new header tag, and

64
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.390
the header tag basically contains some
header information about the page.

65
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.440
So usually, it consists of company logo,
some tagline, sometimes, navigation.

66
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.070
Actually, often, navigation is
contained within the header as well.

67
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.060
As you can see,
this is exactly what we have right here.

68
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.900
The nav tag signifies some content that is
used for navigation within our website.

69
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.712
Afterwards, we have our
familiar h1 tag and

70
00:04:49.712 --> 00:04:52.308
you should absolutely always have that.

71
00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:56.928
And then we have a couple of
set of section tags here.

72
00:04:56.928 --> 00:05:01.900
And within each section tag,
we have a bunch of article elements.

73
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.510
If you look at the HTML5 specification,
you'll see that the way the section

74
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.200
element is defined and the way the article
element is defined is that it's usual or

75
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.550
it makes sense that the article
should go inside the section element.

76
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.210
However, that is not always the case and
there's certainly no hard rule about it.

77
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.605
It's very possible that the article
can also have sections within that.

78
00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:28.730
So, you're certainly not
constrained to have this structure.

79
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.100
We scroll down,
we see we have an aside tag.

80
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.530
An aside tag is basically an element
that communicates that there's something

81
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.670
that is inside of this element that is
related to the main content of the page,

82
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.610
but not as direct a relationship
as the main content.

83
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.546
And finally, we have the footer tag,
which, just like it sounds,

84
00:05:50.546 --> 00:05:52.561
has the footer information in it.

85
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:58.319
Now, the thing to note about all of these
tags is they're all block level elements.

86
00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.905
So as far as we're concerned,

87
00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:03.810
visually we might as well have
just used the div tags everywhere.

88
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.410
However, if you look at the code, it is
obvious how much easier it is to read and

89
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.560
understand what's going on
structurally in this HTML page.

90
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.080
For example,
you can easily see that Article 1, 2 and

91
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.070
3 are somehow related and
are somehow different from Articles 4,

92
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.630
5 and 6 since they live in
two different sections.

93
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.810
That's the power of the semantic elements.

94
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.830
They inherently convey some meaning.

95
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.800
Let's take a look at
this page in the browser.

96
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.010
As you can see,
here's our header element and

97
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.030
the nav element is sitting
right inside of it.

98
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.810
And as you can see, the section article,
the footer, they're all block level

99
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.822
elements since every single one of them
is actually on their own new line.

100
00:06:47.822 --> 00:06:52.820
So in summary, well chosen content for
h1 element is crucial

101
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.750
to search engine optimization, and you
should definitely take advantage of that.

102
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.156
And remember,
semantic elements do allow you for

103
00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:06.345
more meaningful expression of the
structure of your HTML code, HTML page,

104
00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:11.453
but they don't really give you any more
functionality than a regular div or

105
00:07:11.453 --> 00:07:13.668
regular span would without it.

106
00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:17.453
Next, we're going to talk about
Structuring Content with Lists.
