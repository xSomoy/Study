00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.940
[SOUND]
So what is HTML?

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.960
What is the term HTML even mean and
how does ti relate to the web?

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.330
In a minute we'll talk about the big
picture of three technologies

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.620
that drive the web.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.020
HTML, CSS and JavaScript but
where does HTML fit?

6
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.430
In other words, precisely what role
does HTML play in web development?

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.250
As we go along,

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.130
you will see that understanding the
answers to these pretty simple questions

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.690
will actually help you to make correct
coding decisions down the line.

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.450
Well first of all, so
what does HTML stand for?

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.580
Well it stands for,
Hyper Text Markup Language.

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.540
So let's go over each one of these words
and find out what exactly they mean.

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.090
So first of all, hypertext.

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.200
Well hypertext is text which
contains links to other texts and

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.040
that's basically the entire web, right?

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.220
One document points to another document
which points to a bunch of other documents

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.360
and it grows on and on and on.

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.100
Sometimes they link back to
the original document and

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.560
it becomes one gigantic web and obviously
it's not just about text nowadays,

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.240
hypermedia is plays a huge
role in the web today.

21
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.140
You can watch videos, listen to music and

22
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.120
really hypermedia is just
an extension of hypertext.

23
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.980
The next term is Markup.

24
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.570
So markup means to mark something up,
to annotate.

25
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.710
So for example,
it's really all about content.

26
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140
On the Web it's all about content.

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.190
So if you have some content for example if
you have a document you're writing called,

28
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.450
Why I Love This Course,

29
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.580
which is I'm sure is going to be
the title of your next blog post.

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.310
That's the content and you want to
annotate the content to tell the browser,

31
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.630
or to tell some other machine out there,

32
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.885
some other program out there, what this
content is and that's what HTML does.

33
00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:54.395
So HTML goes and
surround that, surrounds and

34
00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:58.815
wraps that content in some
markup language like tags.

35
00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:04.290
So you can see here
Why I Love This Course is wrapped around

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.070
with a title tag which
kind of tells us and

37
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.810
some other software out there that
this is the title of this document.

38
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.420
Which brings me to the first big point,
HTML is human readable.

39
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.180
So these tags look like instructions for
a document structure.

40
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.450
Structure, you don't need to run it
through some interpreter in order to

41
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.690
understand the output
structure of this document.

42
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.760
It's very clear what it is.

43
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.910
The last word in hypertext markup language
is language and language basically implies

44
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.520
that it has its own syntax meaning there's
a right and a wrong way to code it.

45
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.330
So for instance in the example on
the left the closing div tag appears

46
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.390
after the closing h1 tag.

47
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.760
So it's closing order is
switched which causes parsing and

48
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.630
potentially rendering errors.

49
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.590
So the html is language.

50
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.820
You could actually code it up in a way
such that something is wrong and

51
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.230
something will break.

52
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.190
Html also has it's own
semantics which means tag

53
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.330
names can mean something either
to machines or to humans.

54
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.460
Okay.
So let's talk about the three technologies

55
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.920
that drive the web.

56
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.950
Each one has its own
distinctive purpose and

57
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.270
all three of them fit
very nicely together.

58
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.380
Let's start with HTML.

59
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.350
HTML provides the structure
which means what components

60
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.890
does the HTML document have?

61
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.600
For example, it can have one heading,
two paragraphs, and a footer.

62
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.285
Note that that does not tell you anything
about how these components are visually

63
00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:37.170
laid out, what they look like, what
color they are, what font size they are.

64
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.810
It only tells you what are the components.

65
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.770
Like in a house if you have three rooms
and a kitchen you don't really know what

66
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.760
color the kitchen is,
what color the walls of the kitchen.

67
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.000
The only thing you know is what
components make up the house.

68
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.100
The color and style is the role of CSS.

69
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.990
So colors, layouts, font style,

70
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.240
font sizes, in other words any
stylistic types of things.

71
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.480
So for example if we have a heading in our
HTML document, it will tell us what color,

72
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.110
what font size it is.

73
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.690
So that's the job of CSS and the third,

74
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.240
JavaScript, it's job is to provide
behavior, provide functionality.

75
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.010
It adds functionality to the page, so for

76
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.870
example what happens when HTML document
finishes loading into the browser?

77
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.450
Or what happens if I click
on one of the headings?

78
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.170
That's the job of JavaScript
to provide that behavior.

79
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.515
Let's take a look at a quick example
of these concepts in action.

80
00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:38.535
Okay, so the example that we're going to
take a look at is located in the examples

81
00:04:38.535 --> 00:04:42.765
lecture zero one folder, and the file
we're going to look at is called structure

82
00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:46.915
dash only dash before dot HTML and
it's a simple HTML file.

83
00:04:46.915 --> 00:04:51.245
There's nothing but some HTML and
the dummy text data here,

84
00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:55.320
dummy text, and it's got a title,
it's got a heading here.

85
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.880
Couple of paragraphs and
this has a footer,

86
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.280
where in the footer we have
the tech support email address.

87
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.150
For the poor soul whose going to try
to contact this technical support.

88
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.910
Joking obviously.

89
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.030
Okay, so, basically, nothing more than
there's just a HTML and some dummy text

90
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.990
and we're also going to take a look at
structure-only-after.html where it's

91
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.390
the exact same HTML document but
we inserted some styles into it and

92
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.980
some behavior as well.

93
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.840
So for example, the heading,
we made it green and we center aligned it.

94
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.410
The second paragraph has
some margin applied to it.

95
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.850
The footer here has a paragraph
with our text support email, and

96
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.510
if we click in the text support email
is going to pop up and alert for us.

97
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.770
Okay, so let's take a look at both
of these documents in the browser.

98
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.060
Okay so here's the first document.

99
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.740
There is nothing special about it.

100
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.740
It's got that title we talked about,
a couple of paragraphs and

101
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.980
the tech support email at
the bottom in the footer and

102
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.650
if I click on it nothing actually happens
but if we look at document number two we

103
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.830
see that HTML is Structure Only
heading is now green and

104
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.510
a much bigger title and we see that the
position of it has moved to the center.

105
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.390
And we also see that the second paragraph
is in the center and it's much bigger font

106
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.000
compared to before and if we click on
the email address that we talked about,

107
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.540
we see an alert gets popped up with
the message emailing us is useless,

108
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.910
which sounds just about right for most
people's experiences with tech support.

109
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.540
So the thing to notice here is that the
difference between the two HTML document

110
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.510
are the up styles and
the behavior applied but

111
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.220
the structure of both HTML
documents is exactly the same.

112
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.790
So in summary, we spoke about HTML and the
fact that its job is to annotate content

113
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.910
and define document structure and
obviously, as any language,

114
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.400
it has a right and wrong syntax, which
you'll have to learn in order to code it.

115
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.880
And the three Core Web Technologies,
HTML, CSS, and

116
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.870
Javascript work very well together because
each one of them has its own distinct and

117
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.920
precise role and they kind of
don't really step on each other.

118
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.150
The work very nicely together.

119
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.197
Next we'll talk about a bit of
a relevant history of the HTML standard,

120
00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.712
and I do mean relevant.
