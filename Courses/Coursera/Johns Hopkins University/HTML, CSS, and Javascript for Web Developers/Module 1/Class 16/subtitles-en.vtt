2
00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:11.260
Perhaps nothing enhances a website
better than strategically placed images.

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.780
In this lecture we will learn how to
include images in your HTML documents.

4
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.167
Okay, so we're looking at images.html,

5
00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:24.002
which is located in
the examples Lecture10 folder.

6
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:28.790
And you may recognize this file from
a few lectures ago where this is a famous

7
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.330
quote from Theodore Roosevelt.

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.270
And, by the way, I apologize,
I made a typo before.

9
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.060
Theodore Roosevelt is spelled with an E.

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.233
So for you eagle eyes out there who
noticed that I misspelled Theodore I

11
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.320
apologize.

12
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.530
It was just a typo.

13
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.540
Anyway our task here is to display
an image right before the quote itself.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.840
And we actually have
a couple of images here.

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.620
And since I wanted to start with one,
let me comment this one out, and

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.160
at the same time show you what
an HTML comment looks like.

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.170
And it's pretty simple, it starts with
a less than bracket, exclamation point,

18
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.970
dash, dash, and then it gets closed
with a dash, dash, right angle bracket.

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.010
And what will happen when you
load this page into the browser

20
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.130
Is that the browser will completely ignore
this comment and will not render it.

21
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.400
So let's take a look at the image
tag that we wanted to discuss.

22
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.919
The image is displayed in HTML using this
img tag which is just short for image.

23
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:33.850
And the src attribute of the img tag is
a URL that points to some image file.

24
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.371
Now this URL is no different
than the href that you've seen

25
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.592
with the regular link A tag.

26
00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:42.723
It could be a relative URL, or

27
00:01:42.723 --> 00:01:47.900
it can be an absolute URL,
even one that contains an external link.

28
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.430
Next, we specifiy the width and
the height of the image.

29
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.750
While not absolutely required,

30
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.560
it's a really good idea to always
specify the width and the height.

31
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.460
And I will demonstrate to you
in a few minutes why that is.

32
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.130
And also the alt tag which
is used by screen readers

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.500
that help people with visual impairment.

34
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.430
Let's save the document and
take a look at it in the browser.

35
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.976
As you could see, this is the image
that we included in our HTML.

36
00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:21.057
The interesting part here is that
it appears as if it's another

37
00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.905
character within our text,

38
00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:27.630
which should right away tell you that
an img tag is an inline element.

39
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.050
If it weren't,
the image would be on its own line,

40
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.000
pushing everything behind
it onto a new line.

41
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.388
Next let's take a look at the other
img tag and uncomment it so

42
00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:39.668
we could use it within our page.

43
00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:44.710
As you could see this is an external
link pointing to some image on the web.

44
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.320
Let's save the file and
preview it in the browser again.

45
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.128
Let's reload it.

46
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:55.480
As you could see, we get this image of, I
think ants, crawling on a blade of grass.

47
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.310
It's very often the case
that you use images

48
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.610
as sort of these anchors within
your visual layout of your page.

49
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.420
And if this images take time to load,
the page might appear jumpy.

50
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.160
So this is actually the primary reason
why you would want to use the width and

51
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.530
the height of the image.

52
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.350
You want to tell the browser
to reserve this space and

53
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.310
to visually partition your page such that
it knows that there should be something

54
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.380
going on in there even if
it takes time to load it.

55
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.110
So let's simulate what would happen to
our layout if we removed the width and

56
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.210
the height from this image.

57
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.180
Let's go ahead and save it,
go to our webpage.

58
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.369
And instead of just reloading it, since
our Internet or at least my Internet is

59
00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:42.062
pretty fast here, I'm going to
simulate Internet being very slow.

60
00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:47.067
And we'll see how the fact that this
paragraph and this paragraph is visually

61
00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:51.880
separated by this image is not
necessarily going to happen right away.

62
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.170
And we'll see some jumping.

63
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.830
But the way we're going to
accomplish that is by bringing up

64
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.550
the Chrome developer tools.

65
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.229
And I'm on the Mac so
I'm going to press Option+Cmd+I.

66
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:07.870
And if you're in Windows,
I believe it's Ctrl+Option or Ctrl+Alt+I.

67
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.136
And I'm going to go to the Network tab.

68
00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:13.490
And if you notice here,
there is a throttling setting here.

69
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.620
And it says No throttling.

70
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.730
What I'm going to change that to,
the lowest possible setting.

71
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.600
And now I'm going to go ahead and
reload the page.

72
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.850
And watch what happens in
terms of this space between

73
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.730
the Theodore Roosevelt and
the actual quote.

74
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.140
So let's go ahead and reload the page.

75
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.410
And noticed how it jumped.

76
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.720
The first there was Theodore Roosevelt
was right next to the quote,

77
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.010
and then once the image
loaded it jumped in.

78
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.130
And the reason that happened was because
the browser did not up front know

79
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.360
how large the image was going to be.

80
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.030
Even worse if you're relying on the image

81
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.470
to give some sort of a visual
layout to your page and for

82
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.900
some reason the image did not load,
for example the URL could be broken.

83
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.340
So let me go ahead and break it just by
removing a couple of letters from the URL.

84
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.624
And if URL is broken, this is what
you're going to get if you don't specify

85
00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:11.950
the width and the height of the image.

86
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.590
Let's go back to our page and
let's click reload, and there you go.

87
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.530
If we relied on a specific amount of
space between the quote and the footer

88
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.620
of this page, well we can no longer see
that space since the image did not load.

89
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.410
However, if we go back and
undo this and still break the URL, yet

90
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.700
specifying the width and the height of the
image, let's go back and reload the page.

91
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.890
You'll see that even though the image
is not loading, the visual spacing and

92
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.070
the visual layout remains
correct as we intended it to be.

93
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.640
So to summarize,
images can truly enhance your website,

94
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.530
especially if you use them correctly.

95
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.314
And remember to always specify width and
height of the image tag whenever possible,

96
00:06:03.314 --> 00:06:06.667
because without it,
it may break your layouts.
