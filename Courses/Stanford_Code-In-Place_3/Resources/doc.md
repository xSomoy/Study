One of the most common libraries to create graphics in Python is called Tk (short for "tkinter"). Tk is a powerful graphics library that should be automatically installed for Windows and Mac along with Python when you installed it. While Tk's great, some of the functions are hard to use. For this reason, we provide our own small graphics library that is built on top of Tk and makes it easier to use. It's not a replacement for Tk - it just adds a few new functions to make certain things like drawing text easier. You can always explore the full Tk library if you're interested in seeing what else you can do!

While any graphics projects we create for you will have the necessary graphics files included, you can also download this graphics file, unzip it, and add [**graphics.py**](https://cs106a.stanford.edu/graphics.zip) to your project folder if you're starting from scratch. Then, all you need to do is add from graphics import Canvas to the top of your code

### Importing
To use our graphics library, you must first import it at the top of your program, by adding this line of code to the top of your file:

```
from graphics import Canvas
```
