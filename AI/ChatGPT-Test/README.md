> I want to learn programming 

```
ChatGPT: Great! Programming is a valuable skill that can be useful in a wide variety of fields and can open up many career opportunities. There are many programming languages to choose from, and the one that is right for you will depend on your goals and interests. Some popular programming languages include C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

To get started with programming, you will need to:

Choose a programming language to learn. You might want to consider factors such as the language's popularity, the types of tasks it is typically used for, and its level of difficulty.

Set up a development environment. This will typically involve installing a code editor and any necessary libraries or frameworks.

Learn the basic syntax and structure of the programming language. This will usually involve working through tutorials and exercises to get a feel for how the language works.

Practice writing and running code. The best way to learn programming is to write a lot of code, so try to work on small projects or exercises on your own to build your skills.

There are many resources available online to help you learn programming, including online tutorials, video courses, and textbooks. Some popular websites for learning programming include Codecademy, Khan Academy, and Coursera.

> write a python program that sorts files using file type as a unique parameter

```
Sure! Here is a simple Python program that sorts files in a given directory based on their file type:
```
`Code:` [Test-0](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t0-fileSort.py)
```
This code will create a dictionary with file types as keys and lists of file names as values. It will then iterate through the files in the given directory, split the file name and file extension, and add the file name to the appropriate list in the dictionary based on its file type. Finally, it will print the sorted file names for each file type.

> create a 24h clock in python
```
Sure! Here is a simple Python program that displays a 24-hour clock:
```
`Code` [Test-1](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t1-24hourClock.py)
```
This code uses the time module to get the current time and then extracts the hour, minute, and second from the struct_time object returned by time.localtime(). It then formats the time as a string in HH:MM:SS format and prints it to the console. The while loop runs indefinitely, and the time.sleep(1) call causes the program to pause for 1 second before updating the time again.

> same thing in js
```
Certainly! Here is the equivalent JavaScript code for displaying a 24-hour clock:
```
`Code` [Test-1.1](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t1.1-24hourClock.js)
```
This code uses the Date object to get the current time and then extracts the hour, minute, and second using the getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds() methods. It then formats the time as a string in HH:MM:SS format and prints it to the console using the console.log() function. The displayClock() function is called again using the setTimeout() function after a delay of 1 second, causing the clock to update continuously.

```
> same thing in c
```
Sure! Here is the equivalent C code for displaying a 24-hour clock:
```
`Code` [Test-1.2](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t1.2-24hourClock.c)
```
This code uses the time() and localtime() functions from the time.h header to get the current time and store it in a struct tm object. It then extracts the hour, minute, and second from the time structure and prints them to the console in HH:MM:SS format using the printf() function. The while loop runs indefinitely, and the sleep() function from the unistd.h header causes the program to pause for 1 second before updating the time again.

> in php too
```
Certainly! Here is the equivalent PHP code for displaying a 24-hour clock:
```
`Code` [Test-1.3](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t1.3-24hourClock.php)

```
This code uses the time() and localtime() functions to get the current time and store it in a tm array. It then extracts the hour, minute, and second from the time array and prints them to the console in HH:MM:SS format using the sprintf() function. The displayClock() function is called again using usleep() to cause a delay of 1 second, causing the clock to update continuously.

> what about assembly? 
```
It is certainly possible to write a program to display a 24-hour clock in assembly language, although the specific details will depend on the specific assembly language and platform you are targeting.

Here is an example of how you might write a program to display a 24-hour clock in x86 assembly language using the NASM assembler:
```
`Code` [Test-1.3](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t1.4-24hourClock.asm)

```
This code declares a global variable time to store the current time, and a function display_clock to extract the hour, minute, and second from the time variable, format them as a string, and print them to the console using the printf() function. The display_clock function is called in an infinite loop, and the sleep() function is used to cause a delay of 1 second before calling the function again.

```
> in java
```
Certainly! Here is the equivalent Java code for displaying a 24-hour clock:
```
`Code` [Test-1.5](https://github.com/xSomoy/ChatGPT/blob/master/t1.4-24hourClock.java)

```
This code uses the Calendar class from the java.util package to get the current time and extracts the hour, minute, and second using the get() method with the appropriate constants. It then formats the time as a string in HH:MM:SS format and prints it to the console using the System.out.printf() method. The while loop runs indefinitely, and the Thread.sleep() method is used to cause a delay of 1 second before updating the time again.
