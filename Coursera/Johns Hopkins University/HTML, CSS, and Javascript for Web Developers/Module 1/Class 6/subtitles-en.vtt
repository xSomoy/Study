00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.627
[SOUND]
If

2
00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:09.352
you do any kind of development at all,
especially web development, there will

3
00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:13.258
definitely come a point where you're going
to have to ask some help from somebody.

4
00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:17.443
And what I'd like to do in this lecture is
give you a couple of resources where you

5
00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:21.563
can ask for help, as well as give you some
tips and tools that you can use in order

6
00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:24.645
to make your questions better and
easier to communicate.

7
00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:28.110
Now, obviously if you have any
questions regarding the course or

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.079
even the coding questions inside the
course you are more than welcome to ask

9
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.044
these questions at coursera.org.

10
00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:37.462
However there are resources that
you could use to get help and

11
00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:39.660
get answers to your questions.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.550
And one of the premier resources
on the web is stackoverflow.com.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.700
I cannot tell you how many times this
site saved me in my development,

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.900
because I did know something or
something was difficult to figure out.

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.840
And the community developer community out
there is huge and it's ready to help you.

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.060
And as you can certainly go and
turn around and

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.780
contribute to the developer community
back through the site as well.

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.400
So stackoverflow.com,
definitely remember this website.

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.471
Now when you ask coding questions, it's
obviously very helpful to the people who

20
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.542
you are asking the question from
if they can look at your code.

21
00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:17.674
And you can't really shift the entire
code to them, so one way of

22
00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:21.502
doing it is just to cut and paste your
codes straight into the question itself.

23
00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.424
And you could probably get away
with that a lot of the times, but

24
00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:28.009
it's usually much more helpful for
you to provide some actual working code,

25
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.020
that the people looking at it can look
at it and diagnose and help you with it.

26
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.550
You'll certainly get your chances of
answering a question, and answering

27
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.660
a question quickly much higher if you
provide something that they can work with.

28
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.380
Well there's a couple websites I'd like
to show you that can help you with that,

29
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.013
especially when we're talking
about web development.

30
00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:48.729
One of them is called, jsfiddle.net.

31
00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.144
And what the site does it lets you
write HTML, CSS, JavaScript code and

32
00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:54.775
share that code via link.

33
00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:59.661
So I'll give you a very quick example,
I'll just write, h1, and

34
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.224
say Hello Coursera.

35
00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:06.627
And if I click Run, you'll see that in
the result pane, I have Hello Coursera!

36
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.766
Well I can go to my css pane and
change that real quick and

37
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:13.600
I know we haven't learn about CSS yet,
but just bear with me here.

38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.751
And I could change it and
say that the color which should be red.

39
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:21.157
So if I run it again, now the color of
Coursera, Hello Coursera, becomes red.

40
00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:23.992
Now if I click the Save button right here,

41
00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:27.722
I'll get a unique URL that I
could then copy and paste.

42
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.460
And get to exactly the same page
with all the code ready to go and

43
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.260
with the result of it right there.

44
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.080
So that's really helpful, because if
you just provide this link to people

45
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.020
they'll be able to take
a look at your code.

46
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.560
They can also fork it themselves and

47
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.400
forking meaning you could create
a new fiddle based on this one.

48
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.440
They can correct your code or
provide some additional code and

49
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.370
then you can look at yours versus theirs
and actually examine the solution.

50
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.580
So jsfiddle.net is a great resource.

51
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.520
There's another website
that I absolutely love and

52
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.610
that website is called CodePen.io.

53
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.410
And this website is actually founded and

54
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.280
maybe cofounded I'm not sure,
by Chris Coyer.

55
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.980
When it comes to HTML, CSS and

56
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.830
JavaScript in the web developer community,
Chris Coyer is certainly a huge name.

57
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.820
He actually started a website called
csstricks.com and if you'd like we can

58
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.080
actually go there real quick,
tricks.com, it's css-tricks.com,

59
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.140
which is like a one stop shop
on a lot of different tutorials,

60
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.445
answers, and it's all about CSS and HTML.

61
00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:36.890
Css-tricks.com is by itself
a great resource that

62
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.220
actually I've used quite a bit as well.

63
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.751
But back to CodePen.io,
CodePen.io allows you to do something very

64
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.605
similar to JSFiddle.net except
there's lots more here.

65
00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:51.058
There's really a whole community
that surrounds this website,

66
00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:53.632
because you can actually
look at featured Pens,

67
00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:57.211
meaning featured sets of solutions
that will probably amaze you and

68
00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:01.187
you could actually look at the code as
to how they achieve those solutions.

69
00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:04.311
So using the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

70
00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.727
Let's go ahead and give a quick try.

71
00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:06.957
Let's create a new pen.

72
00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:09.357
And you don't have to sign up for
it if you don't want to,

73
00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:10.819
you could just remain anonymous.

74
00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.814
But certainly if you sign up it's much
better, because you'll be able to then go

75
00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:17.954
back and look at all of your work,
it'll be saved in one place.

76
00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:19.150
So we'll do the same type of thing.

77
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.176
We'll say h1.

78
00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:27.632
We'll do Hello Coursera!, and
right there, it shows up automatically.

79
00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:29.590
You don't even have to
really refresh anything.

80
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.440
And let's do the same thing,
let's do h1 and give it a color, red.

81
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.700
And there you go changes
throughout automatically.

82
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.560
And what's really cool and

83
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.620
this is actually one of the newest
features they have is you can actually

84
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.640
have a console just like you
have a console and a browser.

85
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.613
If you pull it up I could say
something like var x = 'Hello

86
00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:53.912
Coursera!' and I could say x or

87
00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:59.360
console.log(x) and
it spits out Hello Coursera back.

88
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.930
So you basically have a browser
that you could work in and

89
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.170
develop in remotely anywhere you are.

90
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.330
And again, if you actually click Save and

91
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.500
save this, you can take that
URL right there, copy it and

92
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.060
then provide it to somebody else,
to help you with your solution.

93
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.450
And there's the entire solution we just
had is right there in front of you.

94
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.944
So I highly encourage you to
check out these websites and

95
00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:27.699
to keep them in your arsenal as resources
not only for looking things up, but

96
00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.025
also to use it for asking questions.

97
00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.125
It will help you quite
a bit in the long run.
