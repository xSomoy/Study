[MUSIC] Hello, and welcome to the course. I'm very happy you decided to enroll, and
most importantly, start the course work. Just to introduce myself, my name is Yakov
Heiken, and I will be your instructor for this course. I've been teaching part-time at
graduate computer science program of Johns Hopkins University for
over ten years. My full time job is developing small and
large scale web applications, working with both front end and
server side technologies. In this course, I'm hoping you
will not only learn a lot, but will also have a lot of fun doing so. In the first module,
we will dive right into HTML5. We'll start with going over how you should
set up your development environment, then we'll learn HTML5 basics,
introduce HTML5 content models and why they matter and finish off the module
with going over some essential HTML5 tags. As you'll see, learning HTML5 is not hard. Ready to go? See you in the module.
