00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.600
You've completed Module 1,

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.315
good work, keep
going to Module 2.

3
00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:11.130
Module 3 is when we start

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.680
coding a real website
for a real client,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.615
but to get the most
fun out of it,

6
00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.420
we need the foundation
of Module 1 and 2.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.855
So keep going, it will
be fun, I promise.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.870
Oh, if you want to give us
a five-star rating already,

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.040
who am I to stop you?
