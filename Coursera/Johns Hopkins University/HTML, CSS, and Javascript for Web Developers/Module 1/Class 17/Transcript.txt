You've completed Module 1, good work, keep
going to Module 2. Module 3 is when we start coding a real website
for a real client, but to get the most
fun out of it, we need the foundation
of Module 1 and 2. So keep going, it will
be fun, I promise. Oh, if you want to give us
a five-star rating already, who am I to stop you?
