00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:08.171
[SOUND]
There are many applications for

2
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:12.610
HTML character entity references, however
in this lecture, I will concentrate only

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.860
on a particular problem that
the entity references can solve for us.

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.840
Since HTML uses certain characters for
its syntax, we need a way to differentiate

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.900
between those characters as HTML and
those same characters as content.

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.380
If we want the browser to
interpret special HTML

7
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.110
characters as regular content,
we need a way to escape them.

8
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.800
In other words, we need a way to tell
the browser not to interpret them as HTML.

9
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.880
Specifically, there are three characters
that should always be escaped to make

10
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.620
sure they don't cause rendering issues,
either right away or down the line.

11
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470
And these characters are the following.

12
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.980
The < character,
the > character and the &.

13
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.440
Instead of using the < character,
you should use the HTML entity

14
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.350
which starts with & and
then followed by lt;.

15
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.963
So if you put in your HTML, &lt;,

16
00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:13.720
what the browser will interpret
this as a < character.

17
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.122
And similarly, for
the > character, it's &gt;.

18
00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:25.914
And for the & it is &amp;.

19
00:01:25.914 --> 00:01:30.130
So let's take a look at some HTML
to see this concept in action.

20
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.640
Okay, so we're looking at the document
called html-entities-before.html

21
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
which is located in
the examples Lectures08 folder.

22
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.390
And this document contains a quote
from one of the US presidents,

23
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.450
Theodore Roosevelt, which happens to
be one of my favorite quotes of his and

24
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.650
a very weird looking h1 content.

25
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.430
So we can take a look at it,
it says don't be afraid

26
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.320
to be <then a 100% success & >more;.

27
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.730
So let's take a look at what
this looks like in the browser.

28
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.240
As you can see,
our heading didn't really do so well.

29
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.780
It says, Don't be afraid to be more and

30
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.010
there's a whole bunch
of words missing here.

31
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.660
Well the reason this is going on is
because the browser is interpreting this

32
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.920
left angle bracket as
a beginning of a tag.

33
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.970
And then it looks at the word then.

34
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.780
It doesn't quite understand
what kind of a tag that is and

35
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.930
basically skips just about everything
between the left angle bracket and

36
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.090
the right angle bracket and
just says the word more.

37
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.290
So we could fix that very
easily with substituting

38
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.670
the < angle bracket with
the HTML entity reference.

39
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.000
And once we're at it, we might as well
substitute the other two characters,

40
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.784
the & and the >.

41
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.990
We'll save the document,
go reload our webpage, and as you can see,

42
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.430
the entire h1 tag content
is displayed on the screen.

43
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.180
In reality, HTML contains a whole ton
of different HTML entity references.

44
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.350
And obviously we're not going to be
able to go through most of them.

45
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.410
However, one particularly common
one is the copyright symbol.

46
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.910
And the main reason why we use
an HTML entity reference for

47
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.600
it is because it's not really very
readily found on any keyboards out there.

48
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.180
However, we could very easily put that in.

49
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.730
So let's go ahead and
put it right here after the year.

50
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.730
And the copyright entity
reference is just &copy;.

51
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.880
So let's save it and
reload it in our browser.

52
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.290
And here's the copyright symbol that's
appearing right after the year and

53
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.580
before the word copyright.

54
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.820
There's another HTML entity reference
that is very commonly used and

55
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.340
unfortunately, a lot of
time misused as well.

56
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.040
Let's say for
example that in the last sentence here

57
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.435
that ends timid souls who
neither know victory nor defeat.

58
00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:02.335
Let's say we wanted the words victory nor

59
00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:05.855
defeat never to wrap, but
always stay the same.

60
00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:07.335
So, what do I mean by that?

61
00:04:07.335 --> 00:04:11.510
Let me pull the browser and
make it a little bit less wide.

62
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.150
And as you can see, the word victory nor
defeat is split up into different lines.

63
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.230
Let's say I didn't want that.

64
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.150
For whatever visual reason I
wanted the words victory nor

65
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.020
defeat to always stay the same.

66
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.430
So if it is going to wrap,
it should either not wrap at all or

67
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.960
wrap all together.

68
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.270
Well, the way you do that is
with a non-breaking space.

69
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.860
And the way you use it is nbsp;.

70
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.790
Not breaking space, or
removing all spaces between the words.

71
00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:49.900
So now let's take a look what
it looks like in the browser.

72
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.500
We'll go ahead and refresh it.

73
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.120
And now you'll see that the words victory
nor defeat as we squeeze the browser and

74
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.770
make it a little bit less wide, they will
either both drop to the next line or

75
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.569
they will stay in the same line, but
they will not be separated anymore.

76
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.020
But let me caution about misuse
of this entity reference.

77
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.490
A lot of people use this entity reference
if they want to make a space between,

78
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.880
let's say the word critic and the word
who, and they will put a few spaces.

79
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.821
Let's say they need a few spaces in it.

80
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.848
And if I now refresh the browser,

81
00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:27.840
I see now got a few spaces between
the word critic and the word who.

82
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.490
And that's a total misuse
of this entity reference.

83
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.440
If you ever wanted to have spaces,
or extra spaces, between some words

84
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.480
in the text, what you would do is you
would probably wrap around some text

85
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.830
in a span tag and then apply some margin,
in this case left margin,

86
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.430
to the span tag to remove it
the further from the word critic.

87
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.350
But you should never use
the non-breaking space HTML and

88
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.350
the reference For that purpose.

89
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.680
Let me show you another HTML entity
reference that is very commonly used.

90
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.950
And it's especially useful when somebody's
trying to write an HTML based email.

91
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.270
Since the email clients are notorious for
using a much more limited character set

92
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.380
than UTF-8, some of the characters
sometimes get messed up.

93
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.430
So let me show you what I mean.

94
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.386
Let's go to the web page and
instead of viewing this web page in UTF-8,

95
00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:28.928
we'll change the encoding to something
more limited like Windows-1252.

96
00:06:28.928 --> 00:06:34.820
And if you notice, some of the quotes
became these very weird characters.

97
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.360
So how do we solve that?

98
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.608
Well, the way we could solve it is by
using an HTML entity references of quote.

99
00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:48.280
And if we preview this in a browser again,
and let's refresh the browser.

100
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.580
And now there are quotes.

101
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.630
Maybe they are not the same type
of curly quotes as before, but

102
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.870
they're quotes nevertheless.

103
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.380
So in summary,
we looked at HTML entities, and

104
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.520
they help avoid rendering issues, and
especially with those three characters

105
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.580
that HTML can try to render instead
of thinking of it as content.

106
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.590
We also saw that sometimes
you can safeguard with these

107
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.160
HTML HTML entities safe guard against
more limited character set encodings.

108
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.790
And you could provide characters
not available in the keyboard.

109
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.650
For example, like we provided
the character of copyright

110
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.650
that was at the end of the document.

111
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.660
That certainly is not on any of
the keyboard that I've seen, but

112
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.990
you could still display that
character using the HTML entity.

113
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.033
Next we're going to talk about
making text hyper with linking.
