00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.457
[SOUND] Okay, so here I am in Mac OS, and

2
00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:09.440
I'm actually using
the latest one as of this

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.357
recording, which is El Capitan.

4
00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:17.630
And let's go ahead and,
I already downloaded Sublime Text.

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.291
So, let's go ahead and double click
that and, and install that real quick.

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.220
Very easy it just opens up this window.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.200
We just drag it to my applications folder.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.560
And after about a second it's done.

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.950
Just verify that it's actually in here.

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.126
It is, so I can close that, close that,
and go ahead eject the mount.

11
00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:40.836
And actually now if I do command space,
and

12
00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:45.830
start typing some sublime it will
come up Sublime Text right there.

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.790
I said yes, I want to open it for
the first time.

14
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.020
And actually, I want to drag it right
next to Chrome, that I already installed.

15
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.360
Okay, so this way I could
actually quit at this point.

16
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.360
And the next thing I want to do,
is we want to install Git.

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.290
So we're going to go ahead and
install the latest version of Git, and

18
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.270
we'll go to Google and I will just,
search for download git for Mac.

19
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.170
And that's the first link comes up,
that's exactly what we need.

20
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.260
And hopefully it will start
downloading in about a second.

21
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.804
Or we could just click ourselves and
download it ourselves.

22
00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:23.960
Okay, so it started to download.

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.280
Okay, so once it's done,
we'll go ahead and open it up.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.670
Double click on it, and now we have to
double click the package installer.

25
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.610
And it says here, that our security
preferences at the moment is such that,

26
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.580
we're not allowed to install anything
that is not from the Mac App Store.

27
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.270
That's not a problem, what we're
going to do is just click OK, and

28
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.260
we'll go to our preferences and
we'll go to security.

29
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.240
Right here, allow apps downloaded from but
we really need to have it anywhere.

30
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.310
So, we'll go ahead unlock that and
we'll click anywhere.

31
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.050
It says,
yes I do want to confirm anywhere.

32
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.720
After we install,

33
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.770
we can always put it back to the original
setting so we're not unsecure.

34
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.210
And now, we can double click on that file.

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.540
And go ahead and go through the prompts.

36
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.850
Install, give it that password,
admin password and we're done.

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.920
So now we have to just double-check
that 2.6.3 is actually installed and

38
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.830
is in our command line.

39
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.800
So we'll go ahead and do command-space and
we'll pull up the terminal.

40
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.417
And in the terminal we'll say
git dash dash version, and

41
00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:36.100
it's 2.6.3, which is exactly what we need.

42
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.300
Okay, so Git is installed.

43
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.880
The next step is to install browser sync.

44
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.630
Well in order to install browser sync,
we first need to install node JS.

45
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.209
So we'll go ahead and go to say download.

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.270
Download node js for Mac and here it is.

47
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.290
And it says here Mac installer,
we'll go mature and dependable.

48
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.140
Okay, once that's done let's go ahead and
open it up and I will click it.

49
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.200
To install we'll go through
the prompts Yes we agree,

50
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.950
install, can give it the admin password,
and we're done.

51
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.620
And it just says here,

52
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.805
that we have to make sure that
/usr/local/bin is in our path.

53
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:27.695
Well, let's go ahead and
make sure of that, we'll go to terminal.

54
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:30.225
Well actually, what we'll do
is we'll restart the terminal.

55
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.830
It's always a good idea to restart the
terminal after things like that install.

56
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.840
And we'll say, node, dash, dash, version.

57
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.840
And that's the right one.

58
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.710
And another one is npm, which stands
fore node package manager, dash,

59
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.720
dash, version, which is actually
what we're really after right now.

60
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.940
And it seems like that's working, as well.

61
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.300
We'll go ahead and echo the path just
like they told us to to make sure.

62
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.080
And sure enough user local bin is
inside our path, so we're good to go.

63
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.820
So to install browser sync let's go
ahead and Google it first, browser sync.

64
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.010
And we should get the browser sync's,
the webpage and

65
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.121
it tells us to install it we need to
do npm install dash g browser sync.

66
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.960
And dash g just means globally,
not just for our user but for all users.

67
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.920
Well, we're going to go ahead and
copy this command.

68
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.720
But, since there's some new things
that came in the Mac OS El Capitan,

69
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.330
we're going to actually do a sudo command,
instead of just directly installing.

70
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.613
So, do sudo npm install, dash g browser
sync, we'll go ahead and execute that,

71
00:04:35.613 --> 00:04:39.960
it's going to ask us for the password,
we'll give it the password and hopefully,

72
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.538
this will install just fine.

73
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.913
Okay, there were some warnings, and

74
00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:52.660
it's also telling us we should
install developer tools.

75
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.860
We'll go ahead and click OK, because
that's something we're going to need.

76
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.830
Hopefully, you already have
that installed for you.

77
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.030
But if you don't,

78
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.050
this is something that you'll
definitely need as you keep developing.

79
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.030
Okay, it says software was installed, and

80
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.700
lets go ahead and double check that our
browser sync actually got installed.

81
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.470
Lets do browser sync dash dash version,
and sure enough that's working.

82
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.490
Now, I can't guarantee that all these
steps are going to be exactly the same

83
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.840
because depending on what you actually
have already installed on your machine.

84
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.610
These steps might be
a little bit different, but

85
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.110
that's about what you're going to get.

86
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.600
There are some things that
came out as error but

87
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.970
it seems like browser sync actually
installed after all, so we can use it.

88
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.120
So let's go ahead and try it out.

89
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.620
Let's go and open, we're in Terminal.

90
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.490
Let's go ahead and
make a directory called, test site, okay?

91
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.390
And we'll open our subline text and
we'll save this page.

92
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.490
We'll save this page inside
our test site folder.

93
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.650
Users, Yakov, Test Site, and
we'll just call it index dot HTML.

94
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.303
Okay, and now we could actually have
a shortcut here inside Sublime.

95
00:06:04.303 --> 00:06:08.850
If we do HTML then control space should
give us a quick template of a page,

96
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.650
we'll say Hello Coursera.

97
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.590
And we'll just give it one h one,

98
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.760
we'll say again hello Coursera,
okay, we'll save that page.

99
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.820
So now what browser sync is going to allow
us to do is it's going to allow us to

100
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.310
constantly have or
be constant kind of a little server for

101
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.420
us that we could see our
page in the browser.

102
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.080
And at the same time as we
edit our page it will update

103
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.600
everything that we're editing
straight in the browser.

104
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.830
So the way that we'd do that
is we could issue a command.

105
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.120
But first first we'll go
switch the test_site,

106
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.870
we'll cd into test_site, clear that.

107
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.450
It does our HTML, so we'll issue
a command called browser-sync and

108
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.640
say start, say server, and server mode.

109
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.210
And we'll give it another
option called directory.

110
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.499
It will actually serve up the entire
directory, not just the particular file.

111
00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:04.593
And we'll tell it what what
type of files to watch for,

112
00:07:04.593 --> 00:07:09.575
that if any of those files change, I want
you to go ahead and refresh the browser.

113
00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:12.495
And we'll put a star,
meaning I want any type of files that say,

114
00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:14.915
that are going to change
in this directory or

115
00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:19.020
any sub directory, I want you to go ahead
and reload the things in the browser.

116
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.890
So when I press Enter, you'll see that
it already running a local server

117
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.010
on port 3,000 and there's our index.html.

118
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.530
Now if we didn't put
the dash dash directory,

119
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.552
I believe it will it would try
to go right away to index.html.

120
00:07:34.552 --> 00:07:38.720
But since we could have multiple files
here, I'll just leave it at that.

121
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.510
And when we click index.html, you see
it's right there, it's not working.

122
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.000
Okay so in part three of this lecture,
we're actually going to to go ahead and

123
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.010
use BrowserSync and I'll demo to you how
we're going to use it in this course.

124
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.806
And we're also going to go
through some basics of Git, and

125
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.076
how to deploy to GitHub
to host your website.
