1
00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.268
[SOUND]
Okay,

2
00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:11.735
so here I'm in Windows and I'm, for this
installation app I'm using Windows 10 and

3
00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:16.450
let's go ahead, and open up Chrome and
we'll set it as our default browser.

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.200
For now at least, and we'll go ahead and
search for sublime text.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.450
We'll install sublime text three.

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.770
That's the first thing that comes up.

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.930
And what we want is, since I'm running
64-bit Windows, I'll just choose 64-bit.

8
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.630
It will download.

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.061
Let's go ahead and show it in folder.

10
00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:40.950
And we'll go ahead and double click it.

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.860
And basically,
here I'm just taking all the defaults.

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.140
All the defaults are just fine.

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.260
I'll go ahead and set install.

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.360
And that should be done.

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.982
And from here,
search the web or in Windows,

16
00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:57.329
I should be able to now say Sublime and
the first thing comes up is Sublime and

17
00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.210
I can now right-click on the icon here and
say, pin it to taskbar.

18
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.570
We'll drag it right here.

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.860
Okay, well for now we could close it.

20
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.920
And the next that we
need to install is git.

21
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.640
We'll go ahead and go the browser again,
and we'll just type download git for

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.320
Windows.

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350
And the first thing that's
not a sponsored link here,

24
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.490
we don't see any sponsored links anyway.

25
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.400
We'll go ahead and
click Download Git for Windows, and

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.530
it should right away start downloading,
and it is.

27
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.710
And okay, it's done,
let's show it in folder.

28
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100
We'll double get the get
installation file.

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.660
We'll say yes to that.

30
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.037
And we'll click next here, next here,

31
00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:40.650
next here, and next here again.

32
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.530
Once again next, and

33
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.900
when we get to this Window here that says
adjusting your path variable environment.

34
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.530
Make sure that instead of
use git from git dash only,

35
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.650
if you would like to use the regular
command prompt, Windows command prompt,

36
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.500
click the middle one says use
git from Windows command prompt.

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.710
We'll click next after that.

38
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.950
And we'll leave this as is.

39
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.210
And instead of this
MinTTY default terminal,

40
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.020
we'll use the Windows default
console Window, so we'll check that.

41
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.110
I'll click Next, and
finally we'll install.

42
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.290
Okay, it's done.

43
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.540
We don't need to view the release notes,
so we'll uncheck that and click finish.

44
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.800
Now if we go to command line,
which is cmd, command line prompt.

45
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.970
We'll make it full screen and we'll go
ahead and say git --version to verify

46
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.260
that it installed and since it comes
up with git version 2.6.4.windows.1,

47
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.040
which is the version we downloaded,
so our git is working just fine.

48
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.070
Now let me digress for

49
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.020
just a second to clarify something
to avoid future confusion.

50
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.560
I'm going to be using a Mac
throughout the course and

51
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710
I'll be referring to the terminal.

52
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.610
The terminal in the Mac is the same
things as the command prompt or

53
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.280
CMD program on Windows is just
a command line interface.

54
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.710
Meaning it's something
you type commands into

55
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.760
instead of clicking on buttons
to accomplish something.

56
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.990
All the programs we're installing have
commands that are the same whether you

57
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.870
are on Windows or Mac.

58
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.470
However, file system commands
are operating system specific.

59
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.880
For example, a very common difference
is that in order to list the files in

60
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.780
a directory folder on a Mac, you use
the ls command, which stand for list.

61
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.202
However, to list the contents on
a directory on Windows, you have to use

62
00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:33.143
a different command, called D-I-R,
dir command, standing for directory.

63
00:03:35.024 --> 00:03:40.360
The next step is to install Node.js so
we can install Browsersync.

64
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.140
We'll go ahead and go to the browser and
say download nodejs for Windows.

65
00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.640
And the first link that comes up,
guess I didn't spell it very well.

66
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520
First link that comes up is right here.

67
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.925
And we'll go ahead and choose our
Windows install, except I know that I

68
00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:03.814
have a 64-bit one, so I'll go ahead and
choose the MSI installer 64-bit.

69
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:07.827
Once it's done,
we'll go ahead and open it up,

70
00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:10.095
we'll double-click the installation file.

71
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:15.762
And we'll click next,
we'll accept the terms, that sounds good,

72
00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:20.790
add to path to make sure that it's going
to add to path to our console as well.

73
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.090
We'll go ahead and click next,
and we will click install, and

74
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.490
we'll definitely say yes.

75
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.980
And we're done, so the only thing
now to do is, to try to see if null

76
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.370
actually got installed, so we'll actually,
we'll exit to command prompt.

77
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.190
It's always a good idea to relaunch it
again after something gets installed, so

78
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.647
we'll open it up again, make it full
screen, and we'll say node --version.

79
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.940
And that works and another command
from node js is npm which stands for

80
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.050
node package manager and
we'll do --version.

81
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.530
Actually, npm was what we were really
after at this point because we're going to

82
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.770
use node package manager to
install the browser sync plugin or

83
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.550
the browser sync program.

84
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.530
And that seems to work just fine as well.

85
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.600
So the next thing we need to
do is install browser sync.

86
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.460
What we'll go [INAUDIBLE] browser and
we'll search for browser sync.

87
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.590
And the first thing comes
up is right here and

88
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.590
it's actually telling us how to do this,
right.

89
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.548
It's telling us npm install
-g browser sync and

90
00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:29.070
-g is just there for installing it for all
the users, not just your particular user.

91
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.710
So we'll copy the command, we'll come
here and go ahead and paste the command.

92
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.140
And we'll press enter.

93
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.210
Okay, so looks like it installed.

94
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.400
Let's go ahead and verify that.

95
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.430
We'll again exit just in case.

96
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.360
And we'll go back and say cmd.

97
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.659
And now we'll say, I'll make this full
screen again and we'll say browser-sync.

98
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.360
And we'll do --version.

99
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.100
And so now it's working.

100
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.530
Okay, so we're done with our installations
and in part three of this lecture.

101
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.310
I'm going to show you how we're
going to use browser sync

102
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.990
in order to serve in our website and
develop together with it.

103
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.905
And we'll also look into how to deploy and

104
00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:14.166
host your web pages
directly on GitHub.com.
