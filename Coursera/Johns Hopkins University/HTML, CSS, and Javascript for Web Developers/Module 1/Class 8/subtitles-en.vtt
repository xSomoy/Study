00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:06.239
[SOUND]
Let's

2
00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.190
briefly talk about the history of HTML.

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.850
Its usually the case that
the history of any technology

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.410
is not particularly interesting or
exciting and

5
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.030
I can't claim that the history of
HTML is that interesting either.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.360
But there are certain parts of this
history that not only give you

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.860
an understanding of how this
technology was developed, but

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.780
also gives you an appreciation
of certain aspects of HTML

9
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.260
that are still relevant and
applicable today.

10
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.880
So before 1997,
there were no community standards, so

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.860
browsers basically did
whatever they wanted.

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.250
They invented new tags.

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.620
They implemented the same
tags differently.

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.800
I was kind of the wild west of the web.

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.330
And you could go to a website and

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.860
end up being told that your browser is not
compatible with this website so you have

17
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.510
to go get a different browser in order
to even view the website to begin with.

18
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.260
Now around 1997 the World Wide
Web Consortium, the W3C, came up

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.690
with the first standard browsers actually
started to pay somewhat attention to,

20
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.960
which is HTML4 and
they very quickly updated it to HTML4.01.

21
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.060
That standard was, pretty loose,
and, the browser's had, still had,

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.480
way too much leeway inside that standard,

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.530
as to how they implemented it, and
how pages we're being rendered.

24
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.990
So, around 2000, the W3C came up
with another specification called

25
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.040
XHTML 1.0 and
that specification was based on XML.

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.190
And XML is a very rigid but
very clear markup language.

27
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.240
In W3C wanted to kind of pick that up and
keep going, with it and produce XHTML 2.0.

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.850
The problem is that the browser vendors
which at this point already had

29
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.020
a history of not really listening a 100%
to any standard, they decided that

30
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.630
this whole W3C thing is moving way
too slowly, and on top of that,

31
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.330
they felt that the specifications
are really moving in the wrong direction.

32
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.560
So the browsers banded together, the
browser vendors banded together and they

33
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.780
created yet another group that produced
specifications that was called WHATWG.

34
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.510
And WHATWG, that's yet

35
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.150
another abbreviation because
we don't have enough of them.

36
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720
So that group is called WHATWG and

37
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.350
it stands for Web Hypertext
Application Technology Group.

38
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.140
So it's a bunch of browser
vendors that got together.

39
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.250
And this group is much less
democratic than the W3C.

40
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.450
In other words they have one central, one
editor that makes the final decisions so

41
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.300
all the browser vendor representatives
can argue all they want but

42
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.630
at the end the appointed one editor
that kind of makes the final decisions.

43
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.000
And they're the ones that
are driving the entire HTML5,

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.420
what we have now,
they're the drivers behind it.

45
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.330
So for a long time the two organizations
didn't really see eye to eye much at all

46
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.440
and they didn't work together, so

47
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.660
they were really going to
two different directions.

48
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.690
But I think W3C eventually realized
that hey, you know, that organization is

49
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.090
actually being driven by the people and
by the companies that actually matter.

50
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.180
Because they are the guys who
are developing the browsers themselves,

51
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.950
so maybe it's a good idea
to kind of make peace and

52
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.100
try to see if we can
work together somehow.

53
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.380
And this is what happened around 2007,
2009 time frame.

54
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.490
So WHATWG and W3C started sort
of kind of working together.

55
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.750
And what they produced in the end
is what we have now, HTML5.

56
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.360
So what does any of that matter to you?

57
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.860
Well what matters now is that there are
two organizations out there, one is called

58
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.750
W3C and the other one is WHATWG and
they're both in charge of HTML somewhat.

59
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.780
So it could be that you
could get into a situation,

60
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.380
it's certainly possible that a browser
potentially can be compliant

61
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.550
with a specification which isn't yet
even formalized by the official W3C.

62
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.690
So, it makes your head spin a little bit,
doesn't it?

63
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.350
So the way they divided it up is
that W3C is going to be in charge of

64
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.960
the standards since this is what their
bread and butter is, its standards.

65
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.470
And they are going to be in
charge of the HTML5 standard.

66
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.450
And WHATWG is not even going to give
a version to their HTML standard,

67
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.270
they're just going to say it's HTML and
it's constantly evolving.

68
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.220
There is no version.

69
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.270
We never stop.

70
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.150
We keep evolving it.

71
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.100
And that WHATWG, they're the ones
that really implement the browsers.

72
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.050
So what W3C does is it kind of cherry
picks some of the more successful

73
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.320
things that are actually kind of start
to be implemented by the browsers and

74
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.490
they slowly bring it into
the official standard.

75
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.990
So the point of this history,
this quick history lesson,

76
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.020
is that this whole thing
is a bit of a muddy waters.

77
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.670
And it's kind of hard
to keep track of well,

78
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.300
what is the browser supposed
to be compliant with?

79
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.650
But unfortunately it is our job as
developers to keep track of these

80
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.040
capabilities.

81
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.300
And it's particularly important
nowadays because all the major modern

82
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.880
browsers are all evergreen browsers.

83
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.455
And what that means is is that
they silently update themselves

84
00:05:13.455 --> 00:05:14.475
on the users computer.

85
00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:16.645
So you no longer even
need to have the user

86
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.995
acknowledge the fact
that they want to update.

87
00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:22.115
That means that,
which is a good thing actually, right.

88
00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:25.655
Because now every browser is kind of
patched as much as they can be patched for

89
00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:27.650
security reasons.

90
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.770
And also it kind of automatically
without the user intervention

91
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.310
gets the latest greatest features of HTML5
and all of the browser software itself.

92
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.795
But every major browser Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer,

93
00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:45.325
they all are evergreen browsers, so
they update themselves automatically.

94
00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:49.795
So what I would like to do now is
give you a few resources on the web

95
00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:54.130
that will make this job keeping track
of these changes a little bit easier.

96
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.362
The first resource that I
really should share is the W3C.

97
00:05:58.362 --> 00:06:04.508
The W3C HTML5 standard, and this is
a very academic type of reading but

98
00:06:04.508 --> 00:06:09.370
you can still look stuff up in
it that is somewhat useful.

99
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.089
And certainly if you want to kind of
know what the actual standard is that

100
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.380
everybody agreed to,
this is a great document to start with.

101
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.950
Another excellent site that you
should definitely check out, and

102
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.431
kind of keep in your
arsenal is caniuse.com.

103
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:29.717
And this is a site that basically
itself keeps track of HTML5 standards,

104
00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:34.747
SVG standards, CSS standards,
JavaScript APIs and on, and on, and

105
00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:39.706
on in the web space to be able to
tell you which browser supports what.

106
00:06:39.706 --> 00:06:44.584
So, for example if I search for
Srcset, which is a pretty new attribute

107
00:06:44.584 --> 00:06:48.570
that is going to hopefully
come soon to the image tags.

108
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.200
Which we'll talk about it later.

109
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.229
But you can take a look and

110
00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.410
see if when I type Srcset that it will
tell you well this is an attribute.

111
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.550
It will also tell you which browsers at
this point is supported and which ones,

112
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.780
like IE, do not.

113
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.278
And you can yourself take a look at and
see whether or not something that

114
00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.954
a browser let's say you're not
really targeting, you're not really,

115
00:07:07.954 --> 00:07:12.102
don't care so much about, if it doesn't
support it, doesn't support it fully,

116
00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:16.110
you can make the decision whether or not
you want to use that particular feature.

117
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.324
Another great resource
to find out whether or

118
00:07:19.324 --> 00:07:24.568
not your HTML actually is going to work
in browsers is to use a validator and

119
00:07:24.568 --> 00:07:29.080
there's a great validator
provided by the W3.org website.

120
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.394
And you can basically cut and paste
all of your website straight here, or

121
00:07:33.394 --> 00:07:38.133
you could upload a particular HTML file,
or at this point you could even copy and

122
00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:42.332
paste your HTML straight in here and
check whether or not it's valid.

123
00:07:42.332 --> 00:07:47.031
And if it is valid chances are,
very high chances are,

124
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.720
that it will work very
well in the browser.

125
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.567
So let's take a look and
see let's tested out and

126
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:57.732
see if we could validate the W3C's
own page and if we'd click check and

127
00:07:57.732 --> 00:08:01.430
sure enough it tells us that it
is valid or everything is green.

128
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.510
Now when you write webpages in the real
world, you can't always say that I'm just

129
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:13.040
going to go ahead and try to support
every browser that exists in the entire

130
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.680
webisphere, and that's not going to work
because there's just so many of them and

131
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.500
some of them are so outdated.

132
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.980
So it's always a good idea to check
the browser statistics and to see.

133
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.870
Certainly if you are in an organization
that you know all the browsers

134
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.040
that are in that organization
that are being used,

135
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.730
all the browsers and
browser versions, that helps.

136
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.510
But if you're writing an application for

137
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.070
the entire web, it's good to know which
browsers are actually popular, and

138
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.990
which browsers are basically
falling off the edge.

139
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.750
And if you take a look here,
this is a website, w3schools.com,

140
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.800
gives you the browser statistics, and if
you take a look here in September of 2015,

141
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.880
Chrome was basically
crushing it's competition.

142
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.900
And you can see the next one is almost
three times less market share than Chrome.

143
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.880
And you can tell that 65,

144
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.790
66 almost percent of users on
the web are using Chrome so

145
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.670
that seems like a pretty important browser
to make sure that your webpage works in.

146
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.100
And if you're all the way
at 1.4% of market share.

147
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.050
If there some feature that you really,
really want to implement and

148
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.070
all the other browsers implemented but

149
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.660
one of them that has such a little, such
little market share, doesn't implement.

150
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.072
Well, you might want to
decide to go with it anyway.

151
00:09:26.072 --> 00:09:28.590
This is something that you
can make a decision about.

152
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.640
And last, but not least,
is Google.com or any other, really,

153
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.700
search engine that you would like to use.

154
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.940
I don't think there's a day that
goes by that, in web development,

155
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.830
that you don't have to look
something up on the web.

156
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.860
And this is just part of
the day-to-day business.

157
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.000
And if you're going to be in web
development, you kind of have to get

158
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
used to the fact that you have
to constantly look things up.

159
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.280
Things are constantly changing,
and obviously,

160
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.990
no human being can know
it all by themselves.

161
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.930
So to summarize, we went over somewhat
relevant, hopefully, history of HTML,

162
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.950
and kind of saw how it effects
us as developers, even today.

163
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.532
So I gave you some resources for
validation of HTML.

164
00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:12.020
Which kind of gives you a little bit more

165
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.870
of a comfort factor that your HTML
will work in browsers properly.

166
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.260
And I gave you some resources for

167
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.640
feature investigation like the website of
canIuse.com which lets you know whether or

168
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.150
not a particular feature is implemented
in a particular version of a browser.

169
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.320
And we also went over where you
could look up browser statistics so

170
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.660
you can make an informed decision of
what browsers you should even target for

171
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.350
your web application to begin with.

172
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.590
Next we're going to talk about
the anatomy of an HTML tag.

173
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.200
We'll take it apart and see what an HTML
tag is and how to properly code it.
