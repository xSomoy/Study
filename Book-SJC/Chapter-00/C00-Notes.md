# Chapter 00 - Initial Discussion [ Notes ]
##  Computer & Programming Language
****

-  Important 5 Factors of Comupter
    1. Processor
    2. Random Access Memory - RAM
    3. Input / Output Device (I/O Device)
    4. Data Storage (Secondary Memory)
    5. Software or Program
---
- RAM is main/primary memory
- Mnemonics /*Nemoneeks*/ (ADD,SUB,MOV,MUL...) used in Assembly Language
- Assembler does Assembly to machine code
- Fortan = FORmula TRANslation
- COBOL = COmmon Bussiness Oriented Language
- BASIC = Beginers All-purpose Symbolic Instruection Code
- **Pascal is the first moduler programming language**
## Compiler / Intepreter

- Compiler compiles the whole program at once
- Interpreter runs line by line

## About C

- Created in the year **1970**
- Created at **Bell Labratory**
- Created by **Danis Riche**
- ANSI - American National Standard Institute

| **High Level Language** | **Mid Level Language** | **Low Level Language** |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Ada | C | Assembly
| Modula-2  | Forth |
| Pascal | Macro - Assembly
| Cobol |
| Fortan |
| Basic |
----
**Structured and Unstructed Languages**
| Unstructured Language | Structed Language |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Fortran | Pascal |
| Cobol | Ada |
| Basic | Modula-2 |

- Unstructured Language cannot be segmented into small pieces. Ex. No loops but Jump/Goto.

## Memory

- ASCII - American Standerd Code for Internarional Interchange

| 8 bit | 1 byte |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1024 byte | 1 kilo byte |
| 1024 kilo byte | 1 mega byte |
| 1024 mega byte | 1 giga byte |
| 1024 giga byte | 1 tera byte
