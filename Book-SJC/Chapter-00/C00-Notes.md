****

-  Important 5 Factors of Comupter
    1. Processor
    2. Random Access Memory - RAM
    3. Input / Output Device (I/O Device)
    4. Data Storage (Secondary Memory)
    5. Software or Program
---
- RAM is main/primary memory
- Mnemonics /*Nemoneeks*/ (ADD,SUB,MOV,MUL...) used in Assembly Language
- Assembler does Assembly to machine code
- Fortan = FORmula TRANslation
- COBOL = COmmon Bussiness Oriented Language
- BASIC = Beginers All-purpose Symbolic Instruection Code
- **Pascal is the first moduler programming language**
## Compiler / Intepreter

- Compiler compiles the whole program at once
- Interpreter runs line by line
