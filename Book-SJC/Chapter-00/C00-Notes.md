##  Computer & Programming Language


-  Important 5 Factors of Comupter
    1. Processor
    2. Random Access Memory - RAM
    3. Input / Output Device (I/O Device)
    4. Data Storage (Secondary Memory)
    5. Software or Program
>
- RAM is main/primary memory
- Mnemonics /*Nemoneeks*/ (ADD,SUB,MOV,MUL ...) used in Assembly Language
- Assembler does Assembly to machine code
- Fortran = FORmula TRANslation
- COBOL = COmmon Bussiness Oriented Language
- BASIC = Beginers All-purpose Symbolic Instruection Code
- **Pascal is the first moduler programming language**

----

## Compiler / Intepreter

- Compiler compiles the whole program at once
- Interpreter runs line by line

----

## About C

- Created in the year **1970**
- Created at **Bell Labratory**
- Created by **Danis Riche**
- ANSI - American National Standard Institute

| **High Level Language** | **Mid Level Language** | **Low Level Language** |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Ada | C | Assembly
| Modula-2  | Forth |
| Pascal | Macro - Assembly
| Cobol |
| Fortran |
| Basic |
----
**Structured and Unstructed Languages**
| Unstructured Language | Structed Language |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Fortran | Pascal |
| Cobol | Ada |
| Basic | Modula-2 |

- Unstructured Language cannot be segmented into small pieces. Ex. No loops but Jump/Goto.

## Memory

- ASCII - American Standerd Code for Internarional Interchange

| 8 bit | 1 byte |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1024 byte | 1 kilo byte |
| 1024 kilo byte | 1 mega byte |
| 1024 mega byte | 1 giga byte |
| 1024 giga byte | 1 tera byte |

## Practice Questions :-

***Different Parts of Computer and their duty?***
```
1. Processor >> Does the calulation and processeing
2. Random Access Memory - RAM >> Stores data temporary
3. Input / Output Device (I/O Device) >> Takes information from users and
    provide informations to the user.
4. Data Storage (Secondary Memory) >> Stores data permanantly
5. Software or Program >> Set of instrucstion for the computer to do.
```

***What is programming language?***
```
A programming language is a language people use when developing software
to tell a computer what to do. It is a set of instruction for the computer.
```

***What is Compiler and Intrepreter?***
```
Compiler compiles the whole program at once and produce a executable file. On the other hand
Interpreter runs code line by line.
```

***Why people develop different types of programming languages?***
```
People develops different types of programming language for different purposes.
Like FORTRAN was developed for Scientific purpose, COBOL was developed for business purposes.
```

***Mention five programming languages and their developers?***
```
Language  - Developer
---------------------
1. Fortran - John Backus
2. Pascal - Niklaus Wirth
3. Basic - John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz
4. Python - Guido van Rossum
5. C - Danis Riche
```

***Some C Features?***
```
1. C is a structured language.
2. It is a Mid-Level language.
3. C is complied language.
4. It is a general purpose language.

```

***What is Memory? What is Bit and Byte?***
```
Memory is computers storage to store value for calculations.
Bit is the smallest unit of computer storage. 8 bit is 1 Byte.
Computer stored data primarily in bytes.
```

***ASCII value of n,c and g?***
```
ASCII value of 'n' is 110.
ASCII value of 'c' is 099.
ASCII value of 'g' is 103.
```

***How many bytes is 3GB?***
```
3GB is 3 Giga Byte.
3GB = 1024*3 = 3072 Mega byte
3072 Mega byte = 1024 * 3072 = 3145728 Kilo Byte
3145728 Kilo Byte = 1024 * 3145728 = 322,12,25,472 Byte

```

***What is the first CELL address?***
```
First Cell address is 0.
```
